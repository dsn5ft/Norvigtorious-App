Norvigtorious-App
=================
Norvigtorious is an Android benchmarking application specifically designed to complete benchmarks that will be useful to Android developers. When the application is run, the benchmark test, the time it took to execute, the phone's model, and the phone's manufacturer are stored in a database. The data is then compiled and analyzed on the Norvigtorious website so users can compare the average times of different models of Android devices for each benchmark. The chosen benchmarks were picked according to what we believe is most relevant to Android developers, and also inspired by Peter Norvig's "Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years."
